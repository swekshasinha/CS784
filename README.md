## Technologies

![Flowchart](images/flowchart.svg)


* Cryptocurrency prices are fetched in real-time from [Coinranking API](https://coinranking.com/page/cryptocurrency-api)

* JSON response is parsed, necessary fields extracted, and sent through to a Kafka topic via a Kafka Producer in Python

* Spark Structured Streaming application in Scala consumes the messages from the Kafka topic, transforms into required data types via a schema, and calculates aggregates on real-time messages

* Aggregates are calculated using window functions to calculate rolling average for each currency over a timespan. Currently supported aggregates are -

  * Moving Arithmetic Mean
  * Moving Geometric Mean
  * Moving Harmonic Mean

* Cassandra sink is used to persist both real-time prices as well as calculated aggregates from Spark

* Node.js and Express is used to create REST Endpoints to fetch and serve the latest data from Cassandra

* Server-side components are containerized with Docker Compose.

* React, Chart.js, and Material-UI is used to render responsive UI consisting of cryptocurrency cards and real-time dashboard. Updated prices and aggregates are fetched from REST Endpoint.

## Docker Installation

* Download and install [Docker Engine](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=edition&offering=community&operating_system=linux) for your operating system. (Linux recommended)

* Download and install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

* Navigate to the directory where the project is cloned

* In your terminal, run 

```
docker-compose up
```

* Check the logs on the terminal and wait till cryptocurrency messages are being published

* In another terminal, from the project home directory run 
```
bash start-services.sh
```

* To monitor Spark jobs, visit `localhost:8080` in your browser

* Wait a few minutes for the job to execute as it is downloading packages, Spark UI will be updated with master and worker when the job begins

* Visit `localhost:5050` to get the data as JSON. REST Endpoints are -
    - `/latestPrice` fetches the latest price of every coin
    - `/latestPrice/symbol_coin` fetches the latest price of the selected coin.
    - Eg. `/latestPrice/BTC` fetches -
    ```
  {
    "symbol_coin": "BTC",
    "timestamp": "2020-10-02T15:31:56.000Z",
    "id": "1",
    "market_cap": "195148831212",
    "name_coin": "Bitcoin",
    "number_of_markets": "19526",
    "percent_change_24hr": "-3.12",
    "price": "10545.2298078033",
    "total_supply": "18505887",
    "uuid": "Qwsogvtv82FCd",
    "volume": "18990315583"
  }
    ```
    - `/latestAggregate` fetches the latest calculated aggregates of every coin
    - `/latestAggregate/symbol_coin` fetches the latest calculated aggregate of the selected coin in the most recent sliding window
    -  Eg. `/latestAggregate/ETH` fetches -
    ```
    {
      "symbol_coin": "ETH",
      "end_time": "2020-09-23T07:58:30.000Z",
      "arithmetic_mean": "336.0199798016828",
      "geometric_mean": "336.01994915594116",
      "harmonic_mean": "336.0199185102891",
      "start_time": "2020-09-23T07:53:30.000Z"
    }
    ```

* To shut services down, run

```
docker-compose down
```

* Navigate to Kafka installation directory and start Zookeeper in your shell

```
cd $KAFKA_HOME
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties 
```

#### Kafka Server

* Navigate to Kafka installation directory and start Kafka server in your shell

```
cd $KAFKA_HOME
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```

#### Kafka Topic

* Navigate to Kafka installation directory and create a Kafka topic *"crypto_topic"*

```
cd $KAFKA_HOME
bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic crypto_topic \
--create --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1
```

* Check if the topic is created.

```
kafka-topics --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list
```

#### Python Producer
